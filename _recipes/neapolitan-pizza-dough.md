title: "Neapolitan Pizza Dough"
image: neapolitan-pizza-dough.jpg
tags: pizza, dough

ingredients:
- 500g bread flour
- 8g kosher salt
- 350g tepid tap water
- 1/2 tsp dried instant yeast (2g fresh compressed yeast)

directions:
- Start by wisking the bread flour and salt into a bowl. In a separate bowl, whisk together tepid tap water and yeast. Once combined, add to the flour mixture.
- Mix together in a mixing bowl with a dough hook on low speed for 1-2 minutes, until everything comes together and no dry clumps remain. At this point, crank the dough hook speed up to medium-low and knead for 7-10 minutes until soft and sticky. 
- Drop the dough ball into a lightly oiled bowl, covered with plastic wrap and let sit at room temperature for 8-12 hours. After it has doubled in size, place in the fridge for at least 24 hours and up to 72 hours. 
- Turn the dough out onto an unfloured worktop and divide into 3 equal pieces that weigh 270 grams each. Stretch each piece into a taut little ball, using the edges of your hands and the doughâ€™s own stickiness. 
- Place all 3 dough balls in a well-floured proofing box (or rimmed baking sheet covered with plastic wrap). Let proof for 2-3 hours.

After working 6 months at an Italian restaurant with a pizza oven, I tried to re-create the same kind of pizza's at home.
This recipe got as close to the real thing once I shelled out the cash for a pizza stone. In an attempt to avoid using plastic wrap
and save time, I actually devide the dough into oiled glass containers with lids right away and refrigerate for 4-10 days.

aging the dough longer after watching [Adam Ragusea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4ABOKdHEUs)'s video on pizza bread.
