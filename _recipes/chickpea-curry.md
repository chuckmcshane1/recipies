title: "Vegan Chickpea Curry"
image: placeholder.png
tags: indian, curry, chickpea

ingredients:
- 1 Onion, chopped small
- 3 cloves Garlic, minced
- 1 Hot Red Chilli, chopped fine (I use chilli flakes)
- Thumb sized piece Ginger, minced
- 3 tsp Sea Salt
- 1 tsp Ground Turmeric
- 1 tsp Mustard Seeds (powder also works in a pinch)
- 1 tsp Ground Coriander
- 1 tsp Ground Cumin
- 4 Curry Leaves (or 1-2 tsb of curry powder)
- 1 tsp Ground Fenugreek (can be replaced with an extra tbs of mustard seeds or powder)
- 2 tbs Tomato Puree
- 2 cans Chickpeas, drained
- 1 can Coconut Milk
- 1 tbs Coconut Flour 

directions:
- Place a large saucepan over a medium heat and add the oil. When the pan is hot add the onion, garlic, chilli & ginger, cook for 10 minutes â€“ stirring often. This is the most important part of making the curry, getting your base ingredients lovely and golden will insure the finished curry has a powerful flavour. 
- Add the all the spices & cook whilst stirring for another 3-4 minutes to let the spices roast & release their aromatics. Throw in the tomato puree and cook for 1 more minute before adding the chickpeas & stir well
- Deglaze the pan with the coconut milk and stir well then allow it to come to a simmer. 
- Let your curry bubble away gently for around 12 minutes.

This is one of my favorite recipes from when I was strictly vegan. With the recipe you can
have dam tasty home meal in about an hour. I would suggest throwing in some toasted/baked naan
and rice to complete the meal.
