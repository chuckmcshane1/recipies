- 1 pinch of salt
- 1/2 cup melted butter
- 1/2 cup coffee (espresso)
- 5 pieces of unsweetened backers chocolate
- 1 1/4 cups of roasted almonds, chopped

- Preheat oven to 350F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone mats.
- Whisk the flour, baking powder and salt together in a bowl.
- In another bowl, whip the butter and the sugar with a hand-held mixer until fluffy, about 5 minutes. Beat in the egg and vanilla until just combined. Slowly beat in the dry ingredients in 2 additions, mixing just until incorporated.

A calsic Italian cookie that I bing during the holidays. Luckily this recipe is
not straight forward enough that I can bake it on a whim during a work day.
