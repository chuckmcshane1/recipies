Famously called Bottazzi cookies at my place of work. This is due to the high frequency at which I would 
bake the recipe, usually as a means of sobering up from my second job. In an attempt to not eat an entire 
batch in a handful of days, I would offload all the cookies I did not eat the night of baking to co-workers.
