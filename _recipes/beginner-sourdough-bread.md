image: dads-pancakes.jpg
tags: bread, sourdough

ingredients:
- 45g mature starter
- 45g unbleached all purpose flour
- 45g stone ground whole wheat flour
- 90g filtered water at room temperature

- 273g unbleached bread flour 
- 500g unbleached all purpose flour
- 175g stone ground whole wheat
- 660g filtered water @ 90-95 degrees F
- 180g mature levain (just use all of your levain splinter that you made seperately)
- 18g fine sea salt

directions:
- In a glass bowl/jar, combine 45 g mature starter, 45 g whole wheat flour, 45 g unbleached ap flour, and 90 g room temp water; mix until homogeneous. Cover with a loose lid, plastic wrap, etc. and let ferment for 6 hours at 78 F, 26 C, or longer in your room is a little cooler. In the video he uses a fermentation station, I like to leave mine in the microwave or the oven with the light on. 
- Thirty-ish mins before levain is done, start autolyse:
- In a large bowl, combine 500 g unbleached ap flour, 273 g unbleached bread flour, and 175 g whole wheat flour. Mix flours together, then add 660 g lukewarm water (90-95 F, 32-35 C) and mix by hand. 
- Cover dough with plastic wrap or damp tea towel, then let sit 30 mins (aka rest of levain time) in the same warm place you have your levain (oven, microwave, fermentation station, etc.)
- Once time is up, sprinkle 18 g fine sea salt over autolyse dough, then add levain on top and spread across surface using damp hands. 
- Wetting hands as necessary so the dough doesn’t stick, use your hands to combine dough with levain on top. Pick it up, squish it, pinch it, whatever you want until it’s fully combined. If prefered, you can do the rhubaud method and scoop and slap the dough in the bowl (hard to describe, just [watch the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eod5cUxAHRM).)
- Cover bowl back up with plastic/damp tea towel, and place in warm spot to “bulk ferment” for 3 to 4 hours.
- 15 mins into your bulk ferment, “fold” dough by picking up edge of dough and stretching it into the middle, then turn bowl 90 degrees and repeat until you make it all the way around. Do this again 15 minutes later, and after that 30 minutes later, completing 3 total folds. Then let dough rest untouched for remaining time. 
- After 3 to 4 hours, dough should look bubbly and grown in size. Carefully turn out onto unfloured counter, divide in half, then shape each half using hands or floured bench scraper into a smooth ball (or whatever shape you prefer :)
- Cover each ball with upside down bowl and rest 15 mins on counter, then uncover and sit 10 more mins. 
- Flour proofing basket (banneton) or tea towel lined bowl and set aside. 
- Flour top of one dough ball, then carefully flip over so it’s flour side down. Grab bottom of dough (closest to you) and pull/fold into center, then do the same with both sides and the top to make a smooth ball/loaf shape. Flip seam side down, then using pinky fingers drag dough towards you using the friction to smooth surface even more. Repeat with second dough ball. 
- Gently transfer to floured basket/bowl, seam side up, and put in plastic bag/cover so they don’t dry out. Proof in fridge ovenight or at room temp for 6-ish hours? Just a guess, he recommends overnight. 

- Place dutch oven in oven, then preheat to 500 F, 260 C for 1 hour. 
- Once oven and dutch oven are hot, take bread out of fridge, dust surface with flour, and carefully dump loaf from bowl/basket into hot dutch oven. Score loaf using sharp knife/razor (don’t be afraid to make a deep cut!). Put lid on dutch oven and put back into hot oven. 
- Bake at 500 F, 260 C with lids on for 20 mins, then reduce heat to 475 F, 246 C remove lids, and bake 30 more mins until dark brown, borderline burnt, them remove from oven.

Trying to watch a video and follow the instructions in this recipe was causing me to make a mistakes.
I am pre-emptively uploading this recipe to prevent any further mistakes as I experiment with the recipe.
