I found this recipe card buried in one of my moving boxes. This was the recipe my father used
back before I was even allowed to use a stove. He had actualy lost the recipe when I was in my teens.
Until one day I was talking to my grandmother about "the pancakes my dad use to make." She had
actualy gotten the recipe from him when he first discoverd it. Apparently he gotten it from a radio
station.
