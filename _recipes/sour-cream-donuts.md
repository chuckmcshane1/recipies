title:  "Old Fashioned Sour cream Donuts"
image: sour-cream-donuts.jpg
tags: donuts, dessert

ingredients:
- 350g Cake Flour
- 10g Baking Powder
- 8g Salt
- 105g Sugar
- 28g Butter (softened)
- 175g Sour Cream
- 2-3 egg yolks
- 360 g powdered sugar
- 75 ml whole milk
- 1 tbsp vanilla extract
- 1/8 tsp salt

directions:
- Mix cake flour, baking powder and salt together in a bowl (if using pre-mixed cake flow, skip this step).
- Add softened butter to a bowl and slowly wisk in sugar. It should have a sandy texture when done.
- Add the butter sugar mix to a stand mixer with a paddle attachment. Add your egg yolks one at a time.
- Finally add a portion of the sour cream and flour mixture into the bowl in increments until fully mixed.
- Place the dough into a floured bowl, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.
- Roll the dough onto a floured surace about 1/2 inch thick. Then cut out the donuts and holes. Then refrigerate on a baking sheet covered until you are ready to fry them.
- Fry in 350 F vegitable oil for 2-3 minuts or until golden brown and the surface begins to crack. Let oil drip off on a wire rack.
- Mix powdered sugar, milk, vanilla extact and salt together to make your icing sugar (you can heat the glaze if you want it to solidify faster). Add more milk as needed to get the glaze to a point where it can easily coat a donut when submerged.
- Ensure each donut is complete covered in glaze and let dry on a wire rack until the outer coating has completely hardened.

This recipe took me 3 attempts to really nail. The first time the dough was too difficult to handle because I did not flour my work surface enough and the dough was not cold enough. 
The second attempt worked out better, however because I was using a pot that did not retain heat very well I had to get the oil to 375F to take into account the temperature drop when adding the donuts.
