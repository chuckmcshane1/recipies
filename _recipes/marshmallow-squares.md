title: "Marshmallow Squares"
image: dom.png
tags: cake, dessert, marshmallow

ingredients:
- 32 marshmallows (the regular size one, not small and not the new oversized)
- 1 tablespoon water
- 1 can sweet condensed milk (14-ounce)
- 2 cups whipping cream
- Graham crackers (about 2/3 of a box)
- 1/4 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips (not in original recipe, optional)

directions:
- In a double boiler melt your marshmallows with 1 tablespoon water.
- Once melted remove from heat.  
- While constantly whisking add your sweet condensed milk.  Put in refrigerator for 1 hour.
- In a large bowl, whip your cream until you have firm peaks.  Gently fold your whipped cream into your cooled marshmallow mixture.  A rubber spatula seems to work best.
- Butter a large 9×13 casserole dish.  
- Starting with your graham cracker, build your layers of sweet marshmallow cream and graham crackers, ending with your marshmallow cream.
- You should have 3 layers of each.  Melt your chocolate chips in microwave for 20-30 seconds and drizzle over the last layer of marshmallow cream, using a knife run through the chocolate to spread and mix with cream.
- Put in your freezer for at least 6 hours (best if up to 24 hours)
- Cut into squares and serve.

This is one of my favorite cold desserts. It is sweet enough without the chocolate chips,
so I personally skip adding them. If I do make it for you, it's either for a special 
occasion or because we have consensually seen each other naked many times.
