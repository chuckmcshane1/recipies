I stumbled across this recipe when I was 12 year old. It was the first time I both found and baked
something on my own. This was my go to for birthdays until.
The cake is no overly sweet and is very moist. The edges are firm and the enterioir is soft and fluffy giving a
greate texture contrast. If your going for early onset diabetes like me, you can cover this baby in chocolate icing.
