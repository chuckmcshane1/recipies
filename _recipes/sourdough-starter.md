tags: starter, dough, sourdough

ingredients:
- Water
- Stone Ground Rye Flour
- Unbleached All Purpose Flour
- Lukewarm Water (85F)

directions:
- On **Day 1** Weigh your container for the starter and write it down (important for the rest of this guide). Mix 100g of rye flour with 150g of water. Let sit at room temperatuer with a loose fitting lid on your container.
- On **Day 2** Mix 70g of your mature starter (jar weight + 70g of yesterdays stuff), 50g rye flour, 50g all purpose flour and 115g of water.
- On **Day 3** Same as **day 2**
- On **Day 4** Mix 70g mature starter, 50g rye flour, 50g all purpose flour and 100g water.
- On **Day 5** Same as **day 4**
- On **Day 6** 50g of mature starter, 50g rye flour, 50g all purpose flour and 100g water.
- On **Day 7** 25g mature starter, 50g rye flour, 50g all purpose flour and 100g water.
- Repeat feeding from **Day 7** every 12-24 hours. If you're lazy like me, pop it in the fridge and feed once a week (you can probably get away with 2 weeks but your pusing it).

This is a step by step guide on how to create your own sour dough starter. This can be used as a replacement for most recipies that require yeast. You will need to commit to feeding this starter for a few minutes every day for the next 7 days.

### Tips
Desolve your mature starter in your luke warm water before mixing in flour.

Use a glass container (the dough can pull harmful stuff from plastics).

Try stealing the starter from someone who's sour dough you've tried and enjoyed. Apparently some bakeries will give you their starter if you ask.
